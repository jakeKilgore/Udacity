# Udacity
Repository for Udacity Projects

These projects were taken on for the Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree. They consist of several projects covering development with Python, as well as with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The projects are seperated by subject and then again by their project folders, and are intended to be run independently of each other.

# HTML Projects

There is only one project under this category: Basic HTML Webpage.

The goal of this project was to demonstrate familiarity with the syntax and structure of HTML.

# CSS Projects

There are two projects under this category: Animal Trading Cards and Styled Webpage.

The goal of Animal Trading Cards was taking a design mock-up (design-prototype.png) and creating a webpage modeled after the style of that picture.

The goal of Styled Webpage to take the basic webpage from the HTML Project and apply styling to make it look nice.

# Python Projects

There are three projects under this category: Quiz Game, Movie Website, and Adventure Game.

The goal of the Quiz Game was to parse user input for a text-based, fill-in-the-blank quiz.

The goal of the Movie Website was to construct and open a website using python. The website displays movie trailers.
This was also technically a JavaScript project, as I did that as well to handle the animations and to load the trailers.

The goal of the Adventure Game was to create a text-based adventure game where the player controlled a character using text commands. The gameplay elements were modeled after Dungeons & Dragons 5e.

# JavaScript Projects

There are two projects under this category: Pixel Art and Matching Card Game

The goal of the Pixel Art project was to create a webpage with a grid where the user can select a color and click the elements of the grid to color in the squares.

The goal of the Matching Card Game was to create a webpage where the user plays a Concentration-style card game where they flip cards and try to match the symbols on them in as few tries as possible.
